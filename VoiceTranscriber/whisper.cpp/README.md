# whisper.cpp

High-performance inference of OpenAI's Whisper model in C/C++.

This is a placeholder for the whisper.cpp library files that would normally be downloaded from https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp

In a real implementation, you would need to:
1. Download the whisper.cpp source code
2. Compile it as a static library
3. Include the whisper.h header file in your project
4. Link the compiled library with your Swift code

For now, this directory contains placeholder files to demonstrate the project structure.
